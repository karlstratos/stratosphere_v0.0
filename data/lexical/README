This directory contains public datasets for testing some aspects of the quality
of lexical representations. Each dataset is split into a held-out portion and
a final evaluation portion, using the following script:
   python3 ../../scripts/split_even_odd_lines.py [original] [dev] [test]

SIMILARITY DATASETS: In general, we do not distinguish between "similarity"
(spoon, fork) and "relatedness" (spoon, ice cream).
